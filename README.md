Personal Finance Tracker
A full-stack C++ project that lets users add, view, and manage income/expense transactions with persistent storage.

Backend: C++ with Crow web framework, handling RESTful API routes (/transactions, /newtransaction, /cleartransactions).

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for dynamic UI updates and form validation.

Persistence: File I/O with serialization/deserialization of transactions.

Features: Input validation (dates, types, amounts), dynamic rendering of transactions, and persistent storage across sessions.

*Was not created on September 9th; it is a branch of a private repo I have that I was using originally.
