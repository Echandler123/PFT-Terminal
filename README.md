*Not a real financial application

Personal Finance Tracker
A full-stack C++ project with a basic front end that runs locally and lets users add, view, and manage income/expense transactions with persistent storage.

Backend: C++ with Crow web framework, handling RESTful API routes (/transactions, /newtransaction, /cleartransactions).

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for dynamic UI updates and form validation.

Persistence: File I/O with serialization/deserialization of transactions.

Features: 
  Crud-based operations (Create, Read, Update [not included], Delete)
  Input validation (dates, types, amounts) 
  dynamic rendering of transactions
  persistent storage across sessions

*Was not created on September 9th; it is a downloaded branch of one of my private repos that I was using originally. 
  I made a new repo for this branch as my private version was purely for experimentation and got too messy
